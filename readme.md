# everyday scripts

A collection of mini scripts that I run on startup/startdown.    
`arxiv_paper_finder` is a way for me to review some most recent papers on arxiv from the terminal.    
`exclam-tracker` is a way for me to generate some (boilerplate) tasks to do each day (e.g. do some reading, do some math, etc.)    
`time-tracker-2` is what I use to recap each day by writing down what happened (in the terminal still)    
`weekly-review` is modeled after Ben Kuhn's [weekly review](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/)
