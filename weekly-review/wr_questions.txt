# Default Qs.
Was I consistent at my core habits this week? How can I tweak them to be more consistent or more useful?
What did I do this week that was a mistake and how can I avoid repeating it?
How much of this week did I spend on stuff that was truly my comparative advantage? For everything else, how can I get out of the loop?
What did you dislike doing? Like doing?

How "hell yeah or no" did this week feel? How satisfied with each day were you?
